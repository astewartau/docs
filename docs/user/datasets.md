# Datasets

Brainlife uses DataLad to provide seamless access to dataset published on OpenNeuro.org as well as on other open datasets.
Datasets mapped by DataLad can searched and imported directly from within the Brainlife interface.

Head over to the [Datasets Page](https://brainlife.io/datasets) or click on the Datasets Tab.
